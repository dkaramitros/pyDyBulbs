## Information

This Python package allows to compute _dynamic stress bulbs for harmonic vertical point loads in homogenous soil_.

A relevant publication is currently under review in the _ASCE Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering_.

## Instructions

A series of functions to support the computations is provided in `stokes.py`.

The use of these functions is demonstrated in `example.py`.
