## Information

This Python package allows to compute and plot _dynamic stress bulbs for harmonic vertical point loads in homogenous soil_.

A relevant publication is currently under review in the _ASCE Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering_.

## Instructions

A series of functions to support the computations is provided in `stokes.py`. Details on their arguments and outputs are provided in docstrings.

The use of these functions for practical applications is demonstrated in `example.py`.

Typical plots can be produced using `plot.py`.
